    "3. Every factor MUST cite the source URL it came from.\n"
    "4. Always report at least 2-3 factors. For a clean counterparty, list the "
    "POSITIVE signals that justify approval (e.g. long operating history, "
    "audited financials, public listing) with severity LOW. For a risky one, "
    "list the red flags with their true severity.\n"
